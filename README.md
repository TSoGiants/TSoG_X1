# TSoG X1

This repository is for the TSoG X1 Aircraft Project. The repository is used to develop the simulation and testing needed to aid the design of the aircraft.

The simulation is developed in Octave 5.2.

## Overview

The repository is broken up into two sections: Simulation and Testing.

### Simulation
Simulation is used to contain the code for running the simulation as well as any models used in the simulation.

### Testing
Testing is used to contain test cases and associated testing functions needed to run the test cases.

## How to Run the Simulation

Install Octave 5.2 on the machine you want to run the simulation on.

## Development process

This section describes how to contribute to the Project

### 1 Select An Issue

First step is to look through the list of open issues that are not assigned to anyone. Read through the descriptions to understand what the task or problem is. Then when you find one that you would like to work on, assign it to yourself.

### 2 Create An Issue Branch

Next, create a branch for your issue using the following naming convention:

`#<Issue Number>_<Short_Name_Description>`

For example, here is a fake issue (99) about fixing the thrust model:

`#99_FixThrustModel`

### 3 Work On Issue Locally

After creating the branch on the repository, clone the repository to your machine that you will do the development work on.

You are welcome to make as many or as little commits as you want to your issue branch, however **each commit must contain an appropriate message that describes all the changes performed in the commit**. As a suggestion, it is easier to keep commits small and have more of them than to have large commits and have fewer.

If you would like to collaborate with others on the work, feel free to push the issue branches to the repository for visibility.

### 4 Create A Pull Request
